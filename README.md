# Sample-Data-Visualiztion-Projects
A sample of 5 Data Visualization Projects I have completed using SSRS, Power BI, and Tableau

All projects were completed using structured data. All projects can be found at github link above.
Project 1:
	A Cube Database was constructed using AdventureWorks2017 sample database for this project and then imported into SSRS where different visualizations were created. The Cube was made using SQL inside of SSMS, and queries were run using SQL to obtain smaller data set for every visualization.

Project 2:
	Using the same Cube Database as in project 1, this time the database was imported into Power BI, where different goals and data were visualized.
Project 3:
	In this project, PySpark was used to import and preprocess a large data set about college majors from a school in Texas, and then was visualized using Power BI.

Project 4:
	Hadoop was used to preprocess a large data set about alcohol consumption in this project. HQL was used to work with the data before importing into Power BI and visualizing there. The HQL queries are included in the folder for this project in the .txt file. 

Project 5:
	Tablaeu was used in this project to make a short dashboard visualization that includes a map, scatterplot, and some filter/slicers.
